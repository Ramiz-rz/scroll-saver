## Usage

### **Using the Extension**
- **Open the settings popup** by clicking on the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
- **Set Custom Scroll Offset**: Enter a pixel value for the scroll offset to fine-tune your saved scroll position.
- **Smooth Scroll**: Toggle the smooth scroll feature on/off to enable or disable smooth transitions when restoring scroll positions.
- **Scroll Speed**: Adjust the scroll speed (in milliseconds) for smooth scrolling, giving you more control over the speed of the transition.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle dark mode for a more comfortable viewing experience, especially in low-light environments.
- **Save Settings**: After making changes, click **Save Settings** to apply your customizations. A confirmation message will show once the settings have been saved successfully.

### **Reset Scroll Position**
- **Reset Scroll Position**: Click the "Reset Scroll Position" button to instantly scroll back to the top of the page.

### **How it Syncs Across Devices**
- The scroll position and settings are saved in Chrome's sync storage. This ensures that your preferences are available on all devices where you're signed into the same Chrome account.

## Notifications & Feedback
- **Visual Feedback**: After clicking **Save Settings** or **Reset Scroll**, a confirmation message will appear or a subtle animation will trigger, indicating that the action was successfully completed.

## Troubleshooting
- **Settings not saving or syncing**: Make sure Chrome's sync storage is enabled and you're signed into the same Chrome account on all devices.
- **Smooth scroll not working**: Ensure that the smooth scroll setting is enabled. Some websites may disable smooth scrolling for performance reasons.
- **Scroll position not saved correctly**: This may occur on dynamic websites (e.g., infinite scrolling). The saved position may not match the actual position in such cases.
